## NLP with Deep Learning (LSTMs, GRUs)

By: Austin Jenkins

Class: CSCA 5642 - Introduction to Deep Learning

Github Repository: https://github.com/ajenkins198621/csca-5642-final-project
This repository contains the code and analysis for a text classification project using LSTM, GRU, and Logistic Regression models. The project is part of an assignment to explore various machine learning and deep learning techniques for a five-class text classification task.

---

## **Project Overview**

This project evaluates the performance of different models on a multi-class text classification problem:

- Three variants of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models.
- One Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) model.
- A Logistic Regression model as a baseline.

The objective was to identify which model performs best across five classes and analyze their strengths and weaknesses.

## **Key Features**

- **Data Preprocessing**: Uses GloVe embeddings for text representation.
- **Model Implementation**: Implements LSTM, GRU, and Logistic Regression models for comparison.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluates models using metrics like accuracy, confusion matrices, and classification reports.
- **Interactive Demo**: Includes an interactive Jupyter Notebook demo to test models with custom text inputs.
